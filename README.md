🚀 Aspiring Cybersecurity Professional | Future Pentester | SOC Analyst in the Making

👨‍💻 About Me

I’m diving deep into the world of cybersecurity, studying every day with the goal of becoming a penetration tester. What drives me is the thrill of problem-solving, breaking things (ethically 😉), and putting them back together stronger than before.

I sharpen my skills through HackTheBox, CTFs, and personal lab projects — because I learn best by doing, failing, and then solving it on my own. Helping others, working on real-world issues, and learning from mistakes keeps me motivated and always hungry for more knowledge.
