About Me

I am studying cybersecurity with the goal of working in penetration testing. I enjoy solving problems, working through Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, and learning by doing. I am motivated by helping others, overcoming technical issues on my own, and building skills that will prepare me for a future career in cybersecurity.
